## Immortal Threads

Welcome to the homepage of ImmortalThreads! 

Immortal Threads is a novel programming model that brings pseudo-stackful multithreaded processing to intermittent computing. Programmers using Immortal Threads are oblivious to intermittent execution and write their applications in a multithreaded fashion using common event-driven multithreading primitives. Our compiler fronted transforms the stackful threads into stackless threads that waste a minimum amount of computational progress upon power failures. Our runtime implements fair scheduling to switch between threads efficiently.
